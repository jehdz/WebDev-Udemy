# Back-end Intro

Backend developers <br>
They'xre in charge of working with servers and databases<br>
Server is just a computer 


Lampstack --> simple information website. Nothing complex <br>

apache server --> Really good at accepting request and sending responses of files <br>

This was the old way of doing things. You cant run facebook or amazon with this type of system 

application server --> unlike apache that is very simple. W/ a node server you can write scripts. if i receive a login --> check the database and send a response. with node.js we can use javascript on a server 
if post something on fb, the post will get sent to the node server. It will store the post on the db
once that its done, its going to respond with a success message and the post will get posted on the timeline.
You have the power to constantly interact with the frontend. 

load balancer --> listens for http request and notices when a server is too busy and transfer the user to a differnrt server. Balancing it out
